# `meep.adjoint.Visualization`:
# Easy, standardized <span class=SC>pymeep</span> visualization routines
# that *just work*
--- 

  


The `meep.adjoint` python module implementing
<span class=SC>meep</span> adjoint solver includes
an extensive set of tools for graphical visualization
of <span class=SC>meep</span> sessions via
[<span class=SC>matplotlib</span>][MatPlotLib].
Although these tools are packaged with and used by
`meep.adjoint`, they are independent of the adjoint solver
and can be used for convenient visualization of *any* python-driven
<span class=SC>meep</span> session---indeed, it is a specific
goal of the module that the visualization routines can
be invoked, with no arguments, on any <span class=SC>meep</span> geometry
and will do something reasonable and useful in every case.

These and other objectives of the initiative are described in the
first section below, after which we present examples to illustrate
the three key types of plot produced by the module and how the 
default options can be customized.

  0. **Motivation:** Plotting is *much* too hard in <span class=SC>meep</span>, especially
     at the lower end where you just want something quick and easy
     to let you sanity-check your geometry.
     This module attempts to
     provide some simple functions that should *just work* in most cases
     to provide some graphical intuition for what you're working with.
     The spirit of the module is to provide functions that can be called 
     *with no customization options whatsoever* and will do useful
     relevant things by default, but which can also be customized
     in cases where you *do* want to take the time to spruce up the 
     output.

  1. **Visualizing geometries before timestepping.** Call `visualize_sim` to view your simulation prior to timestepping:
>
  ```py3
     from meep.adjoint import visualize_sim

     sim=mp.simulation(...)    

     # insert code for adding DFT cells here
 
     visualize_sim(sim)
  ```

  2. **Visualizing frequency-domain fields after timestepping.** Call `visualize_sim` (same function, same no arguments!) after timestepping to view
     frequency-domain (DFT) fields superposed atop the geometry;
     the function automatically looks inside the `simulation` to determine what
     frequency-domain fields are available to plot.
>
  ```py3
     sim.run(until=200)
     visualize_sim(sim)
  ```
>

  3. **Real-time visualization of time-domain fields during timestepping.** Use `AFEClient` to define 
    a custom-made [step function](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Scheme_User_Interface/#run-and-step-functions)
    that intermittently updates a plot of time-domain fields in real time as your
    meep timestepping run progresses.
>
    ```py3 
       from meep.adjoint import AFEClient

       step_funcs=[ AFEClient(sim, ['Ez'], interval=2) ]
       sim.run(*step_funcs, until=200)
    ```

## Motivation and philosophy


>:bulb: Skip down to the [**`tl;dr` version**](tldr-version) 
    of the motivation and goals of this initiative,
    or click to expand the tabs below for a
    longer-winder account.


??? note "**The error-checking power of visual sanity checks for text-defined geometries**"

    The fact that every aspect of a <span class=SC>meep</span>
    calculation---from the [material geometry][GeometricObject],
    to the [absorbing boundaries][PML],
    to the placement and orientation
    of the [sources][Source],
    to the positions and sizes of the
    [flux monitors][FluxSpectra]---is
    defined by lines of text in script files offers a welcome
    change of pace from the immersive GUI experience of commercial
    CAD tools, as well as a natural platform for complex,
    0ustomized calculations that would be unwieldy or impossible
    to launch from a point-and-click pull-down interface.
    Nonetheless, as convenient as it is to specify geometries
    non-graphically, it's *also* quite useful---arguably even
    *essential*---to review a graphical representation
    of the geometry you input as interpreted by
    <span class=SC>meep</span>, both to confirm that your input
    was processed as you expected and to catch the sorts of
    inadvertent errors---a flux monitor in the wrong place,
    a source pointing the wrong direction---that are
    all too easy to overlook in your python script,
    but instantly obvious upon visual inspection.

    In addition to the usefulness of visual sanity checks
    on your input geometry, it can be helpful to look at
    graphical visualizations of the electric and magnetic 
    fields computed by <span class=SC>meep</span>---both
    the time-domain and the frequency-domain fields---and
    in particular to review how the field distributions 
    evolve in space in the presence of your material geometry.
    This is true even though, in many cases, the ultimate
    desired output of your calculation will be non-graphical,
    sucha a number---a power flux, an eigenmode coefficient, 
    etc---whose computation, again, will be described by
    lines of text you write in a script file. If the calculation
    works correctly as you wrote it and you get 
    a reasonable numerical output on your first try,
    well, bully for you! You have no need of graphical
    visualization aids. For the rest of us---who can't
    figure out why our flux is 10 orders of magnitude 
    too small until we look at the time-domain power flow and
    realize we set things up backward, so that all the 
    excitation power flows promptly *out of*, not into,
    the computational cell---visualization tools can be 
    a lifesaver.
  
 
??? note "Wait, isn't this a solved problem?"

    So we're agreed that visualization---of both inputs (geometries)
    and outputs (fields)---is a good thing. But isn't this a 
    solved problem? After all, <span class=SC>meep</span> offers
    plenty of routines for retrieving as much raw data on
    geometries and fields as any user could want---and, once one
    has the raw data, it's just a matter of choosing from among the 
    infinitude of available tools for plotting and visualization.
    Indeed, already within the <span class=SC>meep</span> documentation
    itself one can find many different types of visualization generated 
    by many different types of tool. What more is left to say?


??? note "Wanted: Quick, easy, *standard* visualization paradigms that *just work* on any geometry"

    Despite the arguably non-issue status of the situation, I would argue
    that the current situation is suboptimal in at least two ways.

    + **(a)** The absence of a single, canonical solution means that, as a <span class=SC>meep</span> user,
    every time you feel the urge to visualize something you have to spend some time and effort
    figuring out how you are going to do it---and then going through the hassle of setting that up.
    In my experience, this was especially true when it came to making movies of the evolution
    time-domain fields---although the problem had been solved with documentation a couple of times
    in the manual, still somehow it felt like a major chore to set this up every time
    I wanted it.

    + **(b)** On a different note, the absence of generally-accepted visualization protocols
    means that everybody's visualizations look different. This is not necessarily tragic, and
    we wouldn't want to enforce sterile conformity, but it might be nice if there were *some*
    notion of "canonical <span class=SC>meep</span> visualization format" to serve as a common
    language.


>:bulb: The motivating desiderata for `meep.adjoint.Visualization`

  With all of that by way of backstory, here were the guidelines that motivated
  the design of these routines.

  1. They should **fully address the three everyday situations that cry out most
      urgently for visualization support**, namely
 
      -  *Simulation geometry before timestepping.* A static image of the simulation geometry at the begininng of the calculation, 
          before timestepping has begun. The important targets for visualization are the following items and their 
          relative positioning vis-a-vis one another: **(a)** the material geometry, **(b)** the absorbers,
          **(c)** the location and nature of sources, **(d)** the position and size of any DFT cells in which
          frequency-domain fields are to be computed.

      -  *Time-domain fields during timestepping.* An animation or movie showing the time-domain fields evolving
          throughout the timestepping. For one thing, this tells you instantly when you have e.g. oriented your
          source backwards or otherwise misconfigured something obvious---you sit and watch all of 
          your "input" power go flying right out of the cell to the left instead of proceeding rightward 
          into the center like you intended---whereas the *frequency*-domain plots produced even by 
          such totally misbegotten simulations can be pretty effective at obscuring even obvious
          culprits.

          Also, after all, the ability to observe essentially time-domain phenomena is one of the
          key reasons to use an FDTD tool in the first place; many frequency-domain problems
          can be solved much more efficiently by frequency-domain solvers than by something like
          <span class=SC>meep</sc>, but they don't produce nice movies showing e.g.
          reflection and diffraction of wave packets from interfaces. So it seems particularly
          appropriate for a time-domain-solver like <span class=SC>meep</span> to offer
          built-in functionality for animating time-domain field evolutions.
          
      - *Frequency-domain fields after timestepping.* A static image showing the amplitudes of frequency-domain fields
         in regions of DFT cells, with the spatial distributiono of Poynting flux plotted for DFT flux cells.

       >:bulb: **A central goal of this module is to provide reliable, easy-to-use routines for
          each of the aforementioned purposes.**

  2. *They should offer a hierarchy of customizability options* for users at different
     places on the willingness-to-suffer-for-their-art spectrum.
     Of course, the goals outlined above---routines that are *easy to use* and *just work*---suggest
     an implementation strategy in which the tools make all the artistic decisions for you; the easiest
     calling convention to remember is the one with no parameters. However, one of the nice things
     about the [<span class=SC>matplotlib</span>][MatPlotLib] backend is how very *extremely*
     customizable it is, and it shouldn't be hard to pass at least some of those options
     on to users of `meep.adjoint.Visualization.` 
     In view of these considerations, the goal of the routines is to offer
     a three-tiered hierarchy of customizability levels.

     a. **Zero-effort calling model for lazy forgetful slackers**SZ

     For users who can't be bothered to memorize or look up library function
     prototypes---or who just want quick and dirty visualization at the
     prototyping stage with the option to clean up later---it should be 
     possible to call the visualization routines on just the `simulation` 
     entity alone *with no configuration arguments whatsoever,*
     with the module making reasonable choices to produce helpful graphics 
     in a standardized format.

     b. **Minimal-effort calling model for the slightly more motivated**

     For users who fall basically into the previous bucket but are
     motivated to change one or another option that otherwise
     obstructs the visualization (like, label font size too large),
     there should be an easy way to configure global settings once,
     after which the user can proceed lazily to call all visualization
     routines with no customization arguments.
  
     c. **Full-customization calling model for diligent nitpickers:**

     Finally, for users who *do* want to invest time and effort to 
     configure plotting options to their liking, the visualization
     module should provide copious customization options to allow
     as much as possible of the visualization to be customized.
  
  
## 2. **Easy visualization of simulation geometries before timestepping: `visualize_sim`**
  
  
As described above, the first visualization task we consider
is that of double-checking the various geometric inputs
supplied to <span class=SC>pymeep</span> when creating a 
[`simulation`](TheSimulationClass):
the computational cell and material geometry, the absorbing boundaries, the exciting sources, 
and any DFT cells for which we requested tabulation of frequency-domain fields. Also described
above was the imperative that, to ensure a maximally memorable calling convention,
the visualization routine be callable on *just the `simulation` class itself with no
other parameters required.*

These objectives are satisfied by the `visualize_sim` routine in `meep.adjoint.Visualization`,
whose calling convention is precision-engineered to be as painless as possible: after
creating a <span class=SC>pymeep</sc> `simulation`
through a call like `#!py3 sim=mp.simulation(geometry=...)`,
you can simply say

```py3
  visualize_sim(sim)
```

and voilà! A new plot window sprouts open to reveal your simulation
in all its glory, looking something like this:
