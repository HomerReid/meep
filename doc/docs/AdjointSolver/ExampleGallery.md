## **Full automated optimization of a cross-router device**

In this example, `meep.adjoint` automatically designs the 
central section of a [four-way router][CrossRouterExample]
to achieve near-perfect routing of power from the `west` input
port to the `north` output port.

The example may be executed as follows:

```bash
   cd ${MEEP_INSTALLATION}/python/examples/adjoint_optimization
   python CrossRouter.py --verbose --visualize --optimize
```

The figures below show results for the 0th (initial), 1st, and final (50th)
iterations. For each iteration, we show **(1)** the geometry, including the
central region that is subject to design optimization, **(2)** the frequency-domain
fields obtained by the forward calculation for the geometry on the given iteration,
**(3)** the adjoint derivative $\partial f/\partial \epsilon$ indicating
how the permittivity in the design region should be updated to improve the objective 
function.

Notice in particular that the forward-field results (center diagram) indicate
that, in the initial geometry, power flows almost directly from the west (input)
port to the east port; in contrast, by the end of the optimization
the power flow exhibits a near-perfect 90&deg; bend with almost all power
flowing out through the north port.

## Numerical validation of adjoint gradients

As discussed in the [Reference Manual](ReferenceManual.md),
the `OptimizationProblem` base class offers command-line options
for estimating objective-function derivatives with respect
to individual design variables---that is, individual components
of the objective-function gradient vector---by numerical finite-differencing. 
This provides a useful check on the accuracy of the
gradient computed via the adjoint method. In this example
we'll apply this technique to the simple
[holey waveguide][HoleyWaveguide] geometry discussed
in the [Overview][Overview], involving a circular hole 
in an otherwise perfect section of a slab waveguide of
permittivity $\epsilon\sups{wvg}$.
For this problem, the design region is the area of the hole,
and we will consider a particularly simple basis consisting of
the single basis function $\{b_0(\vb x)\equiv 1\}$, so that
our sole design variable $\beta_0$ is just the constant permittivity$
$\epsilon\sups{hole}$ of the hole region; the design problem is
to tweak $\epsilon\sups{hole}$ 
to maximize output power flux (flux through the port labeled 'east') 
for fixed input flux from by the eigenmode source2.

The advantage of this as a validating sanity-check for
adjoint calculations is the simple dependence 
of the objective on the design variable:
clearly, transmission through the waveguides can't
be better than perfect, which is what it is
when $\epsilon\sups{hole}\equiv \epsilon\sups{wvg}
and there \textit{is} no hole, so 
the function $f(\epsilon\sup{hole})$ must
be peaked at $\epsilon\sup{wvg}$ and its
derivative vanishes there. This gives one
test on the correctness of an adjoint implementation,
and we get others by looking at the derivative
at other points on the curve, with reference values
be estimated via finite-differencing.

Thus, for a set of 24 $\epsilon\sub{hole}$ values
ranging from 1 to $2\epsilon\sups{wvg}$ we will
compute the objective function and its adjoint-based 
and finite-difference derivatives with respect to
$\epsilon\sups{hole}$.

### Running the calculation serially from a shell script 

The individual calculations may be performed by executing the
[`HoleyWaveguide.py`][`HoleyWaveyguide.py`] script from the
shell with command-line options, i.e.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

python HoleyWaveguide.py ${COMMON} --beta 0  1.0 --filebase B1P0
python HoleyWaveguide.py ${COMMON} --beta 0  1.5 --filebase B1P5
python HoleyWaveguide.py ${COMMON} --beta 0  2.0 --filebase B120
...
python HoleyWaveguide.py ${COMMON} --beta 0 12.0 --filebase BW12P0
```

Note that the only options that vary from case to case
are `--beta 0 xx`, setting distinct values for the design
variable $\beta_0\equiv \epsilon\sups{hole}$,
and `--filebase,` giving different names to output
files so they don't overwrite one another.
The options in common to all cases are:

```bash
COMMON="--verbose --eval_gradient --fd_index 0 --fd_order 2  --res 40 --df 0.25"
```

### Running the calculation serially from Python

The effect of running the shell command
`% python HoleyWaveguide.py OPTIONS`
can be reproduced from a python script or console
by creating an instance of `HoleyWaveguide`
and calling its `run()` method.
In this case, the command-line options OPTIONS
should be passed (as a single string separated by spaces)
to the optional `cmdline` parameter of the `HoleyWaveguide`
constructor, while `run()` takes no arguments:

```py3
import numpy as np

# generate command lines
bs = np.linspace(1.0,12.0,23)
args = " --eval_gradient --fd_order 2 --fd_index 0 "
cmdlines = [ args + '--beta 0 {} --filebase b{}'.format(b,b) for b in bs ]

# run calculations 
for cmdline in cmdlines:
    HW=HoleyWaveguide(cmdline=cmdline)    
    HW.run()
```

### Running the calculation in parallel using `ParallelDesignTester`

Although these calculations aren't particularly time-consuming,
in a multiprocessor environment
we can make them go *really* fast by using the `ParallelDesignTester`
utility distributed with `meep.adjoint`. As described in the
[ReferenceManual](ReferenceManual#2d-running-many-single-point-calculations-in-parallel-paralleldesigntester),
this is a simple
tool provided by `meep.adjoint` for parallel batch processing of jobs 
like the one considered here, which has the advantage of
presenting as a completely transparent drop-in replacement
for your existing serial loop: 
the `entirety` of the rejiggering required to parallelize
your batch is to replace the  `for cmdline in cmdlines` loop 
above with the single line

```py3

ParallelDesignTester('HoleyWaveguide',cmdlines).launch()

```

This will launch a pool of $N$ server processes to whittle
its way in parallel through your batch; for each string
in the `cmdlines` list, one or another server will
instantiate a `HoleyWaveguide` (or any other class you
specify) with those command lines, then call its `run()`
method. 

### Results

Whether executed serially or in parallel, each of the 23 jobs
produces text-based output files named e.g. `b13.out`, `b13.digest,`
and `b13.legend`, where `b13` is the job-dependent
label assigned the `filebase` option. The `out`
file uses a compressed format in which all data 
(objective-function values, adjoint gradient values, 
and finite-difference derivatives) for a specific design
point (in this case, that means a specific value of 
$\beta_0\equiv \epsilon\sups{hole}$) appear on a single
line of the file with labels to indicate the design point;
this is indended for plotting vs. $\beta_0$ or other
post-processing. The `digest` file reports the same
data in a more human-readable format.  The `legend`
file contains information helping to interpret the content
of the other files.

???+ warning "Working directories in `ParallelDesignTester` runs"
     `ParallelDesignTester` creates and changes to a new 
     timestamped working directory for each pool of parallel
     batch jobs; look for your output files in
     subdirectory called something like `HoleyWaveguide_0323.022256,`

For the case at hand, we want to **(a)** concatenate all of the
`.out` files into an omnibus data file, **(b)** sort by the 
design-variable values reported on specific columns, then
**(****c)** plot various data quantities (e.g. objective-function 
value, adjoint gradient components, and finite-difference derivatives, 
each of which appear in their own specific columns)
versus design variable.

![HoleyWaveguideAdjointVsFDResults](images/HoleyWaveguide_AdjointVsFD.png)

We see that $\epsilon\sup{hole}$ derivatives computed by
adjoints agree well with numerical finite-difference data.
