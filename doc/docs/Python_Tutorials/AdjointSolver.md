This tutorial demonstrates the use of <span class=SC>meep's</span> support for
[*adjoint sensitivity analysis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_state_method)
to facilitate automated design optimization via derivative-based
numerical optimization.

## Overview and Invitation
--------------------------------

Before jumping into technical details, let's start by
recalling the bird's-eye view of

### Photonic design optimization: Common problem structure and simple examples

The problems we'll consider all have the following common
general structure: We are given a <span class=SC>meep</span> simulation
geometry---consisting of a material
$\epsilon(\mathbf x)$, an incident field or other excitation source,
and one or more `dft_flux` regions---

### Objective regions and design regions
--------------------------------

The methods we'll illustrate are applicable to a broad class of
optimization problems in which we seek to optimize Poynting fluxes
and/or mode-expansion coefficients in one or more regions of a
geometry by tuning the structure---that is, the spatial
permittivity distribution $\epsilon(\mathbf x)$---of some portion
of the geometry.

More specifically, we'll consider problems with the following characteristics:

+   The objective function is of the form
    $$F\Big( \big\{S_n\big\}, \big\{|\alpha_{nm}|^2\big\}\Big)$$
    where

    + $\{S_n\}=\{S_1, \cdots, S_N\}$ are the Poynting fluxes
        at some user-specified set of $N$ 
        [flux regions](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_User_Interface/#fluxregion)
        $\{\mathcal{V}^o_1, \cdots, \mathcal{V}^o_N\}$, which we call the *objective regions* for
        the optimization problem  

    + $\alpha_{nm}$ is the
      [eigenmode-expansion coefficient](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Mode_Decomposition)
      for the $m$th eigenmode in the $n$th objective region    

    + $F$ is an arbitrary user-specified function of its inputs    

+   The quantity to be optimized is the permittivity distribution $\epsilon(\mathbf x)$
    within some user-specified [volume](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_User_Interface/#volume)
    $\mathcal{V}^d$, which we call the *design region*.

+   The permittivity in the design region is expressed as an expansion
    in some (arbitrary, user-specified) set of basis functions:

    $$ \epsilon(\mathbf x) \equiv \sum_{p=1}^P a_p \psi_p(\mathbf x),
       \qquad \mathbf x\in \mathcal{V}^d$$

    Here $\{\psi_p(\mathbf x)\}, p=1,\cdots,P$ is a set of $P$ scalar-valued basis functions,
    defined for $\mathbf x \in \mathcal{V}^d$ the objective region, and the expansion coefficients $\{a_p\}$
    are the variable parameters in our optimization.

Thus, problems for adjoint-based solvers in meep, you will specify

+ a list of objective regions $\{\mathcal{V}^o_n\}$

+ a design region $\mathcal{V}^d$    

+ a basis set $\{b_d(\mathbf{x})\}$    

+ an objective function $F$    

### Sample geometries

+ Warmup: circular defect in waveguide

A simple warmup problem is a uniform waveguide with a
circular inclusion, in which we want to optimize the 
permittivity distribution in the circle to maximize
power flux through the waveguide:

![](images/AdjointExample1.png)

In this case we have only a single objective region,
and the objective function is simply

$$ F\Big\(\mathcal{V}^o_1\Big)=S_1.$$

## Basis functions and parameterized geometries

### Specifying basis sets

The basis of expansion functions for the permittivity in the design region
is described by a single routine that inputs the normalized coordinates of a point
$\mathbf{x}$ in the design region and returns a vector of length $P$
containing $[\psi_1(\mathbf{x}), \cdots, \psi_P(\mathbf{x})]$.
Here "normalized coordinates" refers to a shifted and scaled coordinate system
in which the design region is centered at the origin and has length 1 in
all directions; so that the normalized coordinates $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$
for points in the design region satisfy $-0.5<\overline{x}_i<0.5$ for all $i$.
then every component of $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$ lies in the range $[-0.5,0.5]$

Here are some examples of basis sets for 2D design regions:

+ A simple polynomial basis set with 4 functions $\{1,x,y,xy\}$:

```python
  def basis(pbar):
      x=pbar[0]
      y=pbar[1]
      return [1,x,y,x*y]
```

+ A basis set for the circular-hole example above
  that contains a single function that vanishes
  outside a circle of (normalized) radius 0.25
  and is 1 inside that circle:

```python
  def basis(pbar):
      x=pbar[0]
      y=pbar[1]
      return [1.0] if (x*x+y*y)<=0.25*0.25 else [0.0]
```

   (Note that normalized radius 0.5 would correspond to the
    maximal inscribed circle in the design region.)

The file `adjoint.py` defines some convenient predefined basis sets:

+ `fourier_basis(kxMax, kyMax)`

    2D Fourier basis. `kxMax, kyMax` are integers specifying the
    maximum spatial frequency in each direction as a multiple of the
    base frequency. The size of the basis is `(2*kxMax+1)*(2*kyMax+1).`
    (The return values of e.g. `fourier_basis(4,3)` is a function
    that may be passed as the `basis` parameter to functions like
    `custom_dielectric` below.)

+ `annular_basis(NR=2, kMax=2, rho_max=0.5, rho_min=0.0)`

    A basis for a disc or annular region, consisting of a
    sinusoids in the angular direction paired with Legendre polynomials
    in the radial direction.

### Parameterized geometries

Having defined a set of basis functions, a design region
with parametrized permittivity described by a basis-set function `basis`
and a vector of basis-coefficients `coeffs`
may be added to a meep geometry by including the following block among its objects: 

```python
 mp.Block(center=design_center, size=design_size,
                        material=custom_dielectric(design_center, design_size, basis, coeffs)
         )
```

Here `design_center, design_size` are the center and size of the design region
and `custom_dielectric` is a function defined in `adjoint.py` that defines
a meep material function given by the weighted basis set.

## Computing objective functions and gradients

Having defined an optimization problem, we compute the value of the
objective function, and its gradient with respect to the expansion coefficients,
by calling

```
  f,gradf = get_objective_and_gradient(sim, forward_sources,
                                       objective_regions, design_region, basis,
                                       objective)
```

where the inputs are

+ `sim`: `simulation` containing your geometry (but no sources, DFT regions, etc.)
+ `forward_sources`: sources for the fields considered by your objective function.
+ `objective_regions`: List of DFT regions on which arguments to your objective function are defined.
+ `design_region`: Design region of your problem
+ `basis`: Function describing basis set, as defined above
+ `objective`: Function describing objective function, as defined above

## Defining basis sets

### Predefined basis sets

**Nomenclature for sinusoids**

In what follows it will be convenient to introduce some
shorthand notation for sinusoids.
For $n=0,1,2,\cdots$ we define
$$ s_n(\theta)\equiv
   \begin{cases}
   cos \nu\theta , \qquad &n=2\nu   \text{even} \\
   sin \nu\theta , \qquad &n=2\nu-1 \text{odd}
   \end{cases}
$$
In general we will specify the size of a Fourier basis
by stating its nonnegative-integer-valued maximum frequency
$\nu\sup{max}\ge 0$, in which case the set contains
$(2\nu\sup{max}+1)$ basis functions
$\{s_0, \cdots, s_{2\nu\sup{max}}\}.
(The $n$ index ranges from 0 to $2\nu\sup{max}$ inclusive.)
The first few sinusoids are
$$ s_0(\theta)=1,
   \qquad
   s_1(\theta)=\sin \theta,
   \qquad
   s_2(\theta)=\cos \theta,
   \qquad
   s_3(\theta)=\sin 2\theta,
   \qquad
   s_4(\theta)=\cos 2\theta, \cdots
$$

#### Rectangular design regions: Plane-wave basis

#### Disc-shaped or annular design regions:
     Legendre-Fourier basis

```
    disc_basis(ell_max=2, nu_max=2, rhobar_max=0.5, rhobar_min=0.0)
```

Returns a basis suitable for a disc-shaped or annular region defined by
$$ \overline{\rho}\sup{min}\le  \overline{\rho} \overline{\rho}\sup{max},
   \qquad 0\le \theta < 2\pi
$$
Here $\overline{\rho}$ is a normalized radial coordinate running from 0
(at the center of the design region) to 1 (on the inscribed circle
of the design region).

The basis functions are products of Legendre polynomials in
$\overline{\rho$} with sinusoids in $\theta$:
$$ b_{\ell n}(\overline{\rho},\theta)\equiv P_\ell(u)s_n(\theta),
   \qquad 
   0\le \ell \le \ell\sup{max}, \qquad
   0\le n \le 2\nu\sup{max}
$$
where $u\equiv 2\overline{\rho}-1$ runs over the usual range
$[-1,1]$ of the Legendre polynomials as $\overline{\rho}$
runs from 0 to 1.$ The total number of basis functions
is $(\ell\sup{max}+1)(2\nu\sup{max}+1)$, and the index 
of $b_{\ell n}$ within the full basis set is
$ (2\nu\sup{max}+1)\ell + n.$ For example, with $\nu\sup{max}=2$ the
first few functions are
$$ \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
   b_0(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&1,
   b_1(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&\sin \theta,
   b_2(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&\cos \theta,
   b_3(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&\sin 2\theta,
   b_4(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&\cos 2\theta,
\\
   b_5(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&u,
   b_6(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&u\sin \theta,
   b_7(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&u\cos \theta,
   b_8(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&u\sin 2\theta,
   b_9(\overline{\rho},\theta})&=&u\cos 2\theta.
   \end{array}
$$
